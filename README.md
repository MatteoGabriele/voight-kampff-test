# voight-kampff-test
Programmatically detect humans, agents, and suspicious account on Github.

This is the core logic behind [AgentScan](https://agentscan.netlify.app), an app I didn’t expect to build, but ended up creating after reading [this article](https://socket.dev/blog/ai-agent-lands-prs-in-major-oss-projects-targets-maintainers-via-cold-outreach) about open source projects being targeted by AI agents.

It applies an opinionated scoring system to GitHub activity signals to classify accounts as human, bot, or potentially suspicious.
The results are indicators, not verdicts. There’s no AI involved, just structured event analysis looking for patterns that feel a little off.

### Install
```bash
npm install voight-kampff-test
```

### Usage
```js
import { identifyReplicant } from 'voight-kampff-test'

const user = {} // <-- `https://api.github.com/users/${username}`
const events = [] // <-- `https://api.github.com/users/${username}/events?per_page=100`

const analysis = identifyReplicant(user, events)
```
